  <h2><a name="pset" id="pset"></a>Pset Policy</h2>
  The following rules apply to all psets throughout the semester.
  <h4>Timeline</h4>
<ul>
<li>Psets are typically released after lectures, and you will have one week (sometimes two) to solve the problems.</li>
<li>The pset submission deadline will be 11:59 pm the day the pset is due.</li>
</ul>
<h4> Late Policy </h4>
<ul>
  <li>If your pset is submitted within 7 days (rounding up) of the original deadline, you will receive partial credit.</li>
  <li>Your late penalty is reflected as a multiplier on the grade you get. This multiplier decreases linearly from 1.0 (full credit) for an on-time assignment, to 0.5 (half credit) for an assignment 7 days late. For example, if the pset were due on a Tuesday at 11:59 pm, then the last day you could hand in the pset and still receive non-zero credit would be the following Tuesday (by 11:59 pm) and the multiplier would bet set to 0.5 at that point. </li>
  <li>Late penalties are calculated only by number of days, rounded up - if you're having trouble, sleep, ask for help if needed, and try tackling the problem the next day! Staying up late into the night is unnecessary, and won't change the penalty! </li>
</ul>
<p>Mathematically, if you earn <i>p</i> points, and submit <i>t</i> days late (between 0 and 7), your modified grade will be: <i>(1.0 - 0.5t/7)p.</i></p>
<p>Additionally, we grant you an <b>Important-Reason Grace Allowance</b> for problem sets:  We grant you <b>3 penalty-free late days</b> for the semester for any <b>important reason</b>. This only waives existing late penalties - it CANNOT be used to extend a pset past a week! You do NOT have to inform us or ask for permission to use your 3 penalty-free late days - you can just use them. Please note that the goal of the allowance is to accomodate serious circumstances that prohibit you from completing your pset in time (e.g., sickness). The allowance is NOT meant to accomodate trivial circumstances. We will let you determine which circumstances you deem serious. This also means that you cannot "save" penalty-free late days — they will be used up as soon as you accumulate late days whether or not you were granted an extension through MIT's Student Support Services (S3). The point is that you do not need to ask for official approval until you run out of penalty-free late days. Any request beyond the allowance requires S3 approval.

</p>
<h4>Collaboration Policy</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Psets should be done individually, unless otherwise stated.</li>
    <li>You can talk to each other, post questions on Piazza, get general advice on strategies, seek help on concepts.</li>
    <li>But all writing and coding should be done individually -- you should not share code or derivations.</li>
  </ul>

<h4> AI assistants policy </h4>
<ul> 
<li>Just like you can come to office hours and ask a human questions (about the lecture material, clarifications about pset questions, tips for getting started, etc), you are very welcome to do the same with AI assistants.
<li>But: just like you are not allowed to ask an expert friend to do your homework for you, you also should not ask an expert AI.
<li>If it is ever unclear, just imagine the AI as a human and apply the same norm as you would with a human.
<li>If you work with any AI on a pset, briefly describe which AI and how you used it at the top of the pset (a few sentences is enough).
</ul>

<h4>Submission Method</h4>
  Problem sets are to be submitted electronically on Canvas or Gradescope depending on the specific submission instructions.
  <!-- via Stellar. Your submission should include
  <ul>
	  <li>a PDF report with its filename being &lt;your_kerberos&gt;.pdf, and</li>
		  <li>relevant source code zipped into a single file named &lt;your_kerberos&gt;.zip.</li>
    </ul>-->
<h4>Grading</h4>
Students with special circumstances should get a note from MIT's Student Support Services (S3).
<br>
Grade release is planned for two weeks after the deadline; we will consider regrade requests submitted up to a week after release.
