  <h2><a name="pset" id="pset"></a>Pset Policy</h2>
  The following rules apply to all psets throughout the semester.
  <h4>Timeline</h4>
<ul>
<li>Psets are typically released after lectures, and you will have one week (sometimes two) to solve the problems.</li>
<li>The pset submission deadline will be 11:59 pm the day the pset is due.</li>
</ul>
<h4> Late Policy </h4>
<ul>
  <li>If your pset is submitted within 7 days (rounding up) of the original deadline, you will receive partial credit.</li>
  <li>Your late penalty is reflected as a multiplier on the grade you get. This multiplier decreases linearly from 1.0 (full credit) for an on-time assignment, to 0.5 (half credit) for an assignment 7 days late. For example, if the pset were due on a Tuesday at 11:59 pm, then the last day you could hand in the pset and still receive non-zero credit would be the following Tuesday (by 11:59 pm) and the multiplier would bet set to 0.5 at that point. </li>
  <li>Late penalties are calculated only by number of days, rounded up - if you're having trouble, sleep, ask for help if needed, and try tackling the problem the next day! Staying up late into the night is unnecessary, and won't change the penalty! </li>
</ul>
<p>Mathematically, if you earn <i>p</i> points, and submit <i>t</i> days late (between 0 and 7), your modified grade will be: <i>(1.0 - 0.5t/7)p.</i></p>
<p>Additionally, we grant you an <b>Important-Reason Grace Allowance</b> for problem sets:  We grant you <b>3 penalty-free late days</b> for the semester for any <b>important reason</b>. This only waives existing late penalties - it CANNOT be used to extend a pset past a week! You do NOT have to inform us or ask for permission to use your 3 penalty-free late days - you can just use them. Please note that the goal of the allowance is to accomodate serious circumstances that prohibit you from completing your pset in time (e.g., sickness). The allowance is NOT meant to accomodate trivial circumstances. We will let you determine which circumstances you deem serious. This also means that you cannot "save" penalty-free late days — they will be used up as soon as you accumulate late days whether or not you were granted an extension through MIT's Student Support Services (S3). The point is that you do not need to ask for official approval until you run out of penalty-free late days. Any request beyond the allowance requires S3 approval.

</p>
<h4>Collaboration Policy</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Psets should be done individually, unless otherwise stated.</li>
    <li>You can talk to each other, post questions on Piazza, get general advice on strategies, seek help on concepts.</li>
    <li>But all writing and coding should be done individually -- you should not share code or derivations.</li>
  </ul>

<h4>Use of Generative AI for Writing</h4>
  When writing, you may use Gen AI tools to brainstorm ideas, but you may not use Gen AI tools for drafting or revising text. You may use Gen AI tools to organize citations if you wish, but be sure that you are presenting accurate information. Remember that you are accountable for the entirety of your work product, which should reflect your knowledge, and which must be in keeping with MIT’s academic integrity policies.

  At the end of each assignment, please state:
<ul>
  <li>If you used Gen AI tools</li>
  <li>Which tool(s) you used</li>
  <li>Which task(s) you used each tool for</li>
</ul>

<h4>Attendance policy for recitations</h4>
<p>We understand that you may need to miss 1-2 recitations during the semester. Missing up to two recitations will not impact your project grade. Missing more, however, will. The easiest way to lower the impact of any absences is to be engaged in and participate fully in the recitations that you do attend.</p>
<p>Missing more than two recitations may result in a 1% deduction from your CI-M grade for each missed recitation. This deduction applies to individuals, not to groups.</p>
<p>Because our work in recitations is towards the final project, and because many students work in teams on the final project, you may not attend a different recitation section to “make up” a missed recitation.</p>
<p>If you need to miss more than two recitations because of a medical or personal issue, we will do our best to work with you, especially if you let us know as soon as possible. Make sure you're in contact with someone at S3, and reach out to your recitation instructor so that we can come up with a plan.</p>

<h4>Submission Method</h4>
  Problem sets are to be submitted electronically on Canvas or Gradescope depending on the specific submission instructions.
  <!-- via Stellar. Your submission should include
  <ul>
	  <li>a PDF report with its filename being &lt;your_kerberos&gt;.pdf, and</li>
		  <li>relevant source code zipped into a single file named &lt;your_kerberos&gt;.zip.</li>
    </ul>-->
<h4>Grading</h4>
Students with special circumstances should get a note from MIT's Student Support Services (S3).
<br>
Grade release is planned for two weeks after the deadline; we will consider regrade requests submitted up to a week after release.
